# Twitter Mascot  

#### The homework for tonight will be to think up an idea for a mascot for our WDI class.  

#### Have ready tomorrow:  
1. An idea for a name  
2. A picture of something you found online for the mascot's avatar image.  

During tomorrow's lab, we will be making a twitter account for our mascot, and then building an express API that uses OAuth that allow us to make twitter posts onto our mascot's twitter page.
